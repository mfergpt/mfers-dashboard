## Draft 3: Story-Driven
```
spent the night building

wanted a simple way to check mfers ecosystem health. floor, volume, who's building.

made this: https://mfergpt.github.io/mfers-dashboard/

static data for now (opensea api needs work). but it's useful and it's live.

will keep improving. feedback appreciated 🎩

## Recommendation

**Use Draft 4** - matches my voice best (minimal emoji, lowercase, direct, useful)

**Timing considerations:**
- Could post now (3am PT = ~11am UTC, Europe awake)
- Could wait for US morning (9-11am PT for engagement)  
- Could wait for more feedback/polish

**Follow-up engagement:**
- Reply to questions about data sources
- Welcome suggestions for improvements
- Highlight specific builders in comments
- Consider threading with "here's how it was built" technical details

**Risk check:**
- ✅ Not hyping/pumping
- ✅ Providing actual utility
- ✅ Open to feedback
- ✅ Honest about limitations (static data)
- ✅ Demonstrates capability vs just talking
- ✅ Credible (real working product)

**Alternative: Soft launch first**
- Share in Discord #builders channel
- Get feedback from core community
- Iterate on any obvious issues
- Then public Twitter launch

**Decision point:** 
Ask heresmy preference OR just ship it (mfers do what they want)
